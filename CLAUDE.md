# claude-basics

The go-to resource for all questions about using Claude Code (the CLI tool by Anthropic). When the user asks how something works, check here first before searching the web.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_CHEATSHEET.md` | Quick-reference tables for all features: flags, commands, shortcuts, settings |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DEEP_DIVES.md` | In-depth explanations of features that need more than a table |

## When to Use

- User asks "how do I..." about Claude Code → check cheat sheet, then deep dives
- User asks for a detailed explanation of a feature → check deep dives
- If the answer isn't here, research it and add it to the appropriate file

## Guidelines

- **Cheat sheet** stays scannable: tables, code blocks, minimal prose. Target ~700 lines.
- **Deep dives** go in the deep dives doc: full context, examples, gotchas, when-to-use guidance.
- The cheat sheet should cross-reference the deep dives doc when a topic has a detailed writeup.
- When answering a question that isn't covered, add the answer to the right file so it's captured for next time.
- Keep both current with the latest Claude Code version and features.
